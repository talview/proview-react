This is a JavaScript module that can be used to include Proview in a website or app that uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for its front-end codebase. It does not currently use any React code internally.

It is designed to work with the v4 version of Proview, this module is mildly opinionated in how proview integrated within our front-end code. The API does not have all the features some features exposed in the core Proview client library. THe client object is still directly accessible at `ProviewClient3` as before

If you use `react-proview` too, we'd love your feedback. Feel free to file [issues, ideas and pull requests against this repo](https://github.com/talview/react-proview/issues).
